---------
## Analysis
- We notice a huge hike in the sales of the resort hotel during the month of June, July and August which makes sense as its holiday season.
- We also notice constant sales in the city hotel all throughout the year. This also makes sense as there is no specific time that one would want to be in a city hotel as compared to a resort hotel.

## Results
- There is a large demand for reservations in the holiday season for the resort hotel, The hotel could hire more staff and make preparations for handling a large amount of customers. As the holiday season gets over the hotel could cut costs on the management as the sales are average.
- As for the constant sales in the City hotel, The hotel needs to maintain their sales and try to increase marketing for increasing sales
